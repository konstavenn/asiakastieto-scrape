If the program does not work, try again. Sometimes the code jams up, don't blame me, blame asiakastieto or chrome.

If multiple searches doesn't work, search for people separately. This will work with a higher propability.

If the code is still not working update your chrome. This should work on chrome version 105.0.5195.125, if you have a much newer version you might need to
download a compatible chromedriver from "https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads". Save it into the "driver" folder replacing the old driver for your os.
Use the same name.

If you have problems please contact: konsta.venn@taikatech.fi

Add the following info to your email:
- operating system
- chrome version
- if you have changed the chromedriver, the chromedriver version
- dd folder if search fails during execution
- who were you searching for when the search failed
- any other info that might be useful
